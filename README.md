# Lazy Loading Demo

This repository demonstrates various techniques for implementing image lazy loading in web development. Each approach is showcased in a separate HTML file, as described below:

- `index_1.html`: Implements the standard, default loading of images without the `loading` attribute. This serves as the baseline for comparison.

- `index_2_lazy.html`: Utilizes the `loading="lazy"` HTML attribute to enable lazy loading of images, which can improve page load performance by loading images as they enter the viewport.

- `index_3_css.html`: Enhances the user experience by adding CSS to display a lightweight, blurred placeholder image until the actual image is fully loaded.

- `index_4_css_js.html`: Integrates JavaScript to smooth the transition between the blurred placeholder image and the actual image, creating a more visually appealing effect as images load.

Each file represents a step forward in optimizing image loading for web applications, showcasing the benefits of lazy loading and enhanced visual transitions.
